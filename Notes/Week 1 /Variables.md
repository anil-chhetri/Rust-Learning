Here's a structured study plan to master **Variables, Mutability, and Ownership Basics** (with a focus on Rust, as ownership is a core Rust concept):

---

### **Study Plan: Variables, Mutability, and Ownership Basics**

#### **Variables and Basic Concepts**
**Objective**: Understand variable declaration, scoping, and shadowing.  
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Materials**: Rust Book (Chapters 3.1, 3.2) or equivalent for your language.  
**Tasks**:  
1. **Theory**:  
   - How to declare variables (`let` in Rust).  
   - Type annotations and type inference.  
   - Variable scope (block vs. global).  
   - Shadowing: Re-declaring variables in the same scope.  
2. **Examples**:  
   ```rust
   let x = 5; // immutable
   let y: i32 = 10; // explicit type
   let z = "hello"; // shadowed later
   let z = z.len(); // shadowing
   ```  
3. **Exercises**:  
   - Declare variables of different types (integers, strings, booleans).  
   - Experiment with shadowing (e.g., convert a string to a number).  
   - Test variable scope by declaring variables inside/outside blocks.

#### **Day 2: Mutability**  
**Objective**: Grasp the difference between mutable and immutable variables.  
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Materials**: Rust Book (Chapter 3.1)  
**Tasks**:  
1. **Theory**:  
   - Immutability as a default in Rust (safety vs. flexibility).  
   - Using `mut` to make variables mutable.  
   - Trade-offs: When to use mutability vs. immutability.  
2. **Examples**:  
   ```rust
   let immutable = 5; // cannot change
   let mut mutable = 10; // can change
   mutable += 1; // allowed
   ```  
3. **Exercises**:  
   - Fix code errors where immutability causes issues.  
   - Convert immutable variables to mutable ones and vice versa.  
   - Compare performance/safety implications (e.g., in multi-threaded code).

#### **Day 3: Ownership Basics**  
**Objective**: Learn ownership rules, moves, and borrowing.  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Materials**: Rust Book (Chapters 4.1, 4.2)  
**Tasks**:  
1. **Theory**:  
   - Ownership rules:  
     1. Each value has one owner.  
     2. Values are dropped when the owner goes out of scope.  
     3. Ownership can be transferred (moved).  
   - Move semantics (e.g., transferring ownership of a `String`).  
   - Introduction to borrowing (`&` and `&mut`).  
2. **Examples**:  
   ```rust
   let s1 = String::from("hello");  
   let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2 (s1 invalidated)  
   let s3 = &s2; // borrow s2 (immutable reference)  
   ```  
3. **Exercises**:  
   - Write functions that take ownership of variables.  
   - Fix "use after move" errors.  
   - Experiment with borrowing (e.g., pass references to functions).  

---

#### **Day 4: Review and Practice**  
**Objective**: Reinforce concepts and troubleshoot common errors.  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Tasks**:  
1. **Review Key Points**:  
   - Immutability vs. mutability trade-offs.  
   - Ownership rules and move semantics.  
   - Scope and shadowing behavior.  
2. **Coding Challenges**:  
   - Create a program that uses shadowing to transform data.  
   - Build a function that transfers ownership and observe the effects.  
   - Fix ownership errors in provided buggy code snippets.  
3. **Common Pitfalls**:  
   - Modifying immutable variables.  
   - Using variables after moving ownership.  

---

#### **Day 5: Mini-Project**  
**Objective**: Apply concepts in a practical context.  
**Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Project Idea**:  
- Build a simple program that:  
  1. Uses mutable variables to track state (e.g., a counter).  
  2. Transfers ownership of a `String` between functions.  
  3. Uses shadowing to reuse variable names.

### **Additional Resources**  
- **Rust Book**: [Variables and Mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html), [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html).  
- **Practice**: [Rustlings Exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) (Sections on variables and ownership).  
- **Visualization**: Use [Rust Memory Model Tools](https://rust.godbolt.org/) to see ownership in action.

### **Self-Assessment Checklist**  
- [ ] I can declare and use mutable/immutable variables.  
- [ ] I understand how shadowing differs from mutability.  
- [ ] I can explain ownership rules and fix move errors.  
- [ ] I can use borrowing to pass references without transferring ownership.
